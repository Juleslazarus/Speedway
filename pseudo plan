so i want the main page to be focused on his prior work and his biggest jobs 
so that future potential clients can see what he's done. maybe before the gallary starts or after it starts or both
i want to have a 'get a quote' button  and the quotes.html page will have the form that is sent to the email provided by him. 
the buttons will have animations like so: 

::root {
    --SWDRed: #b02425
}

button {
    background: --SWDRed;
    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 0 yellow; 
}
button:hover {
    box-shadow: inset (100% of button pixel size) 0 0 0 yellow; 
}

or using: 

button {
    background: --SWDRed; 
    animation: btnAnimate; 
}

@keyframe btnAnimate {
    20% {translateY(5px)}
    50% {translateY(-5px)}
    75% {translateY(5px)}
}

for the slideshow ima make an arrow icon with an event listener that tells 
image 1 2 or 3 to opacity '1' or '0' depending on which is already opacity '1';
